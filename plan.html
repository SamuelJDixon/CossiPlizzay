<h1>CP1406 - Assignment 1 - Project Plan - CossiePlay</h1>
<p><strong>Name:</strong> Samuel Dixon<br>
<strong>Login:</strong> JC229389</p>
<h2>Goals</h2>
<p>The main goals of this project are to create a website that spreads the word of the company CossiePlay, 
<br>thus increasing its costume sales and also increasing the number of people that come to the monthly cosplay parties. </p>
<h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
<p> Success for this website will be measured in two major ways. The first is the number of coustumes ordered per week, we expect to see a significant increase.<br>The second way success will be measured is the attendance of the monthly cosplay party, where we expect an increase in attendance of more than 30 guests. </p>
<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>The target audience is high school students and young adults, ages 16-25. Because this is the target audience, the major design elements of the site will be aimed at a younger audience who are more tech savvy. The website will be intuitive without being handholding as this age group is know to have a solid understanding of technology.</p>
